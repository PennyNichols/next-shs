If a client-provided tool is deemed unsafe, inadequate, or unusable by our technician, this will constitute a disruption to the normal expected workflow. In such cases, the client will be granted a fifteen (15) minute window, after the completion of any feasible tasks, to resolve the tool issue (e.g., by providing a suitable replacement or contacting our administrative staff for guidance). If the issue is not resolved or a rescheduling request is not made within this window, time lost due to the inadequate tool will be billed at our standard working rates. No initial disruption fee of $150.00 will be applied for such instances, and any applicable fees will only be charged if the disruption directly impedes the workflow. SHS Florida will make reasonable efforts to advise clients on tool requirements prior to project commencement. If a client verbally or in writing confirms understanding and ability to provide a specific tool, SHS Florida staff will rely on that confirmation and will not prompt for further clarification. If a client indicates unfamiliarity with a required tool, our administrative team will provide a written description, image, and purchasing/rental options via email to guide the client. Should a client-provided tool be damaged by SHS Florida staff after being deemed acceptable for use, the replacement cost of the tool (with reasonable depreciation for tool age and condition) will be deducted from the client\'s invoice.
